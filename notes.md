# Strategies
## Mean reversion
Identifies or computes a time series that is stationary, or from which we can easily calculate the mean, and assumes that any deviation from the mean is temporary, and will eventually return to the mean.
### Pair trading
A type of mean reversion strategy, where two cointegrated stocks are used to form the time series. For example, we can subtract a gold index from the gold price. The resulting series may be stationary. We can then long or short the two stocks when they deviate, with the assumption that they will eventually revert to the mean.
